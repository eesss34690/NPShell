# NPShell
A NetProgramming Implementation of shell environment

## Structure
- For ```main.cpp```, the function keeps getting the new line command.
- The command is wrapped by ```Npshell``` object, which contains the original line and how to process the line.

## Usage
```TODO```

## Future Implementation
- The line should be separated, and each of the node command can be in a individual object for forking and executing.
